  "TaskDescription": "Participants completed a punishment condition-less version of the MID, an instrumental reward task where participants are rewarded based on performance to a timed button response. Participants were instructed to press their index finger button as soon as they see an image of a white square (“target”) in two different conditions. In neutral trials, the white square was preceded by a blue circle (“cue”) and participants were told they could not win or lose money but to still respond as quickly as possible. If participants responded in the allotted time, they were shown an outcome screen with a green check indicating successful response and black text stating “Trial earnings: $0.” In reward trials, the white square was preceded by a green circle and participants were told they could win $3. Successful responses were followed by an outcome screen of a green check and green text stating “Trial earnings: $3”. In both conditions, if participants failed to respond quickly enough, they were shown a black line and black text stating “Trial earnings: $0”. Cue screens were shown for 750ms, the interstimulus interval was jittered between 1500-3000ms, intertrial intervals were jittered between 2000-7000ms, target times were dynamically changed to maintain a 66% successful response rate, and outcome screens were shown for 1000ms. Each run contained 283 frames and 56 trials. We did not include a punishment condition in order to maximize the number of reward response trials with a neutral contrast.",
