  "TaskDescription": "Participants also completed the Shared Reward task, a card guessing task with reward and punishment in two different social contexts (see [cite] for task schematic). Participants were instructed that all cards for the task had an integer value ranging between 1 and 9, and their task on each trial was to indicate whether they thought the presented card would have a value above or below 5. Participants were presented with feedback (1000ms) on if they had made the correct guess (reward) or an incorrect guess (punishment). Some trials contained neutral feedback (i.e., the value of the card equaled 5). Participants played each trial with one of two potential partners: a stranger (an image of an unknown peer) or a computer. Participants were told strangers were previous participants in the study and that they would have an opportunity to be the “stranger” for subsequent participants following their participation. For every “reward” decision, both the participant and their “partner” won $5 each, whereas for every “punishment” decision, both the participant and their partner lost $2.50 each. Participants were told random trials would be selected for final reimbursement calculation. No money was won or lost on trials where neutral outcomes were experienced. The decision phase until a decision was entered or maximum 2500ms, the outcome phase lasted 1000ms, interstimulus intervals were jittered between 850-2550ms and trial-wise adjusted to account for decision phase timing, and intertrial intervals were jittered between 1000-4000ms. Each run contained 265 frames and 54 trials. Outcomes were rigged such that each run summed to 22 win trials, 22 loss trials, and 10 neutral trials (order randomized across sessions).  ",
